# Log4CS
Log4CS is a C#-Written logger for actions that are also written in C# in a game/software (for windows only). To use Log4CS, you must download, modify and use the source code. A release will not be embedded to this git since the Logger will **NOT** work without modification. In the future, we will be adding systems to detect files that contain an action string then logs it using Log4CS.

## Credits

There's no need to credit me for this, this is incredibly simple to make. I thought of making this since there's **no existing Log4CS**. You have full rights to make a git promoting Log4CS, even if it's modified by you or republished.

## Usage

Please make sure to modify your application/game aswell before you use Log4CS. Log4CS may provide **vulnerabilities** exactly how Log4j's vulnerabilities were shown to the world (the exploit is Log4jShell/Log4Shell). Log4CS may be used for **personal and commercial/business use**.
